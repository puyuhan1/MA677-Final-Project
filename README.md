So there is 3 files in this repo: a docx. file, rmd. file, and a pdf. file
docx.file is written on google docs. It is a paper like note following the requirement of this project
rmd.file not only includes notes from docx.file but also some R code helping explaining my understanding to the contents
pdf.file is the report knitted from rmd.file which contains text, R code, and some plots generated using ggplot.
all work is done by myself and I clearly noticed the references in each files
